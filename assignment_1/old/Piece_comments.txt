REMARKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Following numbering used:
	- player 1 / white = 1
	- player 2 / black = 2
	- on the board:
		- empty field = 0 
		- white: 1-King, 2-Knight, 3-Rook, 4-Bishop, 5-Queen, 6-Pawn
		- black: 7-King, 8-Knight, 9-Rook, 10-Bishop, 11-Queen, 12-Pawn

	2. Every type of piece has its own method in class Piece that returns an array with 
		shape (X, 5). X depends on the number of valid moves found.  
	   The columns refer to the following:
		- First and second columns = original x and y coordinates of piece 
		- Third and fourth columns = x and y coordinates of possible move 
		- Last column = number referring to piece (see remark 1). This column is 
			mostly used to indicate if a pawn has promoted to queen, the
			number will then also be that of a queen in this column 
	   Assumption made: a player can only have copies of pawns and queens

	3. General workflow for each method:
		- Get all possible moves 
		- Remove invalid moves based on field (moves that go outside board)
			Invalid moves are indicated with a -1, -1 coordinate
		- Remove invalid moves that go to a place where a player's own piece is 
		- Special / specific cases:
			- Remove invalid leaping (rook, queen, bishop)
			- Remove invalid pawn movement (special case: 'normal' movement 
				and capture movement are different)
			- Remove column switching in case a piece has switched columns 
				5 times already (see also remark 4)
			- Remove invalid king movement where it puts itself in check

	4. Column switching:
		- The class expects an array consisting of two rows (row 1 = white, 
			row 2 = black) and multiple columns. 
		- First 6 columns refer to the pieces in the order given in remark 1
		- Column 7 and onwards refer to pawns that promoted to queens > their 
			column switching has been reset. It's also why pawns are not 
			included in the checks as pawns before reaching other 
			side have switched columns at maximum 3 times.
		- Two values are expected: 0 (False, no column switching allowed anymore) 
			or 1 (True, column switching is allowed)
